### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Semantic HTML: I learned the importance of using semantic HTML elements to enhance the accessibility and readability of my code. By utilizing elements like <article>, and <section>, I was able to create a more meaningful and accessible structure for my web pages.
Working with Lists: I deepened my understanding of how to effectively use lists in HTML. I explored both ordered (<ol>) and unordered (<ul>) lists to present information in a clear and concise way.
Utilizing the <table> Element: I gained hands-on experience with the <table> element, which can be quite tricky if you are new to it. 
Introduction to Media Queries: I was introduced to working with media queries, which allowed me to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide) - This helped me with structuring the HTML code. It was quite intuitive and visual.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This helped understanding how to style bullet points.
